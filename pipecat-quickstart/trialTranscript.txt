[2025-11-02T17:24:49.022+00:00] assistant: Hello Jane Smith, it's a pleasure to meet you. Welcome to TechCorp Inc. I'm excited to discuss
[2025-11-02T17:24:53.898+00:00] assistant: your experience and skills today for the Frontend Developer position. Let's start with your expertise
[2025-11-02T17:24:58.777+00:00] assistant: in CSS. Can you explain the difference
[2025-11-02T17:25:01.317+00:00] assistant: between `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;` and when you would
[2025-11-02T17:25:05.265+00:00] assistant: choose one over the other?
[2025-11-02T17:25:10.881+00:00] user: Sure.
[2025-11-02T17:25:15.622+00:00] user: None completely removes an element from the page layout, so it takes up no space.
[2025-11-02T17:25:17.046+00:00] user: Visibility hidden,
[2025-11-02T17:25:21.701+00:00] user: hides the element, but it still occupies its original space in the layout.
[2025-11-02T17:25:26.530+00:00] user: You would choose display none when you want to hide an element and have other elements fill its place.
[2025-11-02T17:25:28.456+00:00] user: For a responsive navigation menu.
[2025-11-02T17:25:30.185+00:00] user: You would use visibility hidden
[2025-11-02T17:25:33.378+00:00] user: want to hide an element, but keep its space on the page.
[2025-11-02T17:25:35.818+00:00] user: Example, to create a smooth transition,
[2025-11-02T17:25:40.830+00:00] user: element disappears and its space is filled in later or to ensure the layout doesn't shift.
[2025-11-02T17:25:43.122+00:00] assistant: That's a clear explanation. You mentioned using `display: none;` for
[2025-11-02T17:25:47.674+00:00] assistant: a responsive navigation menu. Could you elaborate on
[2025-11-02T17:25:50.773+00:00] assistant: how you would implement that and what CSS or JavaScript techniques you might use to toggle its visibility effectively for different screen sizes?
[2025-11-02T17:26:04.286+00:00] user: Okay.
[2025-11-02T17:26:04.931+00:00] user: So
[2025-11-02T17:26:09.899+00:00] user: what we would do is we would add event listeners
[2025-11-02T17:26:14.918+00:00] user: as well as responsive responsive level using display none.
[2025-11-02T17:26:16.052+00:00] user: Is
[2025-11-02T17:26:17.066+00:00] user: pretty good.
[2025-11-02T17:26:17.729+00:00] user: Right?
[2025-11-02T17:26:20.274+00:00] user: Use media media screens
[2025-11-02T17:26:23.108+00:00] user: made use media queries in CSS.
[2025-11-02T17:26:28.159+00:00] user: Change the minimum width and change the CSS accordingly using media queries.
[2025-11-02T17:26:31.624+00:00] user: Access those media queries via a toggle class
[2025-11-02T17:26:32.722+00:00] user: JavaScript.
[2025-11-02T17:26:34.973+00:00] assistant: That's a good starting point. Can you walk me through a specific example of how you would structure those media queries for a typical responsive navigation menu? For instance, let's say you have a desktop navigation that's always visible, and you want to hide it and show a hamburger icon for mobile screens. How would the
[2025-11-02T17:26:50.253+00:00] assistant: CSS look for both scenarios, and how would JavaScript interact with that?
[2025-11-02T17:27:01.085+00:00] user: Okay. So, for example, we have an HTML
[2025-11-02T17:27:04.691+00:00] user: we have a button as a form of a hamburger menu and a
[2025-11-02T17:27:05.991+00:00] user: ULLI
[2025-11-02T17:27:06.154+00:00] user: I
[2025-11-02T17:27:08.103+00:00] user: navigation links for the nav.
[2025-11-02T17:27:10.042+00:00] user: We'll define the CSS
[2025-11-02T17:27:11.884+00:00] user: And what we'll do is
[2025-11-02T17:27:15.314+00:00] user: change the hamburger menu
[2025-11-02T17:27:16.488+00:00] user: we'll
[2025-11-02T17:27:18.581+00:00] user: be displayed none.
[2025-11-02T17:27:20.408+00:00] user: In our media queries,
[2025-11-02T17:27:25.448+00:00] user: screen size changes to something around seven sixty two or
[2025-11-02T17:27:26.375+00:00] user: pixels,
[2025-11-02T17:27:30.648+00:00] user: change the hamburger menu from display none to display block.
[2025-11-02T17:27:33.234+00:00] user: Hide all the other navbar
[2025-11-02T17:27:34.597+00:00] user: thingies. Right?
[2025-11-02T17:27:37.644+00:00] user: Was that is something that we will do. And, also,
[2025-11-02T17:27:42.238+00:00] user: we would love to add an event listener on the hamburger menu as a button
[2025-11-02T17:27:45.747+00:00] user: that whenever we click it, we can access the actual nav bar.
[2025-11-02T17:27:46.411+00:00] user: Right?
[2025-11-02T17:27:48.762+00:00] assistant: That's a good high-level overview. Let's dig a bit deeper into the JavaScript part. When you say "access the
[2025-11-02T17:27:54.289+00:00] assistant: actual nav bar" on clicking the hamburger menu, what specific JavaScript operations would you perform? Would you directly manipulate
[2025-11-02T17:28:00.525+00:00] assistant: the `display` property, or would you use a different approach? And how would you ensure accessibility for users who might not
