[2025-11-01T20:20:16.862+00:00] assistant: Hello John Doe, thank you for coming in today. I'm excited to learn more about your experience and skills. Let's start with a foundational
[2025-11-01T20:20:23.643+00:00] assistant: question. Can you please describe your approach
[2025-11-01T20:20:25.929+00:00] assistant: to designing a scalable and fault-tolerant system?
[2025-11-01T20:20:35.480+00:00] user: Sure. We would always constantly check logs
[2025-11-01T20:20:39.515+00:00] user: and deploy it on a site like, for example, Versal
[2025-11-01T20:20:41.843+00:00] user: is pretty scalable
[2025-11-01T20:20:42.692+00:00] user: Right?
[2025-11-01T20:20:44.953+00:00] assistant: Thank you for that. While Versal (I assume you mean Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications) can offer some scalability benefits, it's a deployment platform rather than a comprehensive solution for designing a scalable and fault-tolerant system from the ground up. Can you elaborate on the architectural principles and specific technologies you would consider when **designing** such a system?
